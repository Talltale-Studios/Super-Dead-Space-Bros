Ledge Hop: If the player's jump is a few pixels too short to make it onto a ledge, a ledge hop can
be performed, which will do a tiny jump, or add velocity to a jump that is in progress to make it onto the ledge.

Ledge Climb: If the player's jump is a bit too short to make it onto a ledge, a ledge climb can be
performed, which will perform an animation to climb up onto the ledge. Depending on how far off the player is
the animation should be dynamically adjusted to better fit the situation.

Ledge Push: If the player jumps up the side of their head would've bumped against the edge of a
ledge, the player character will be pushed away from the ledge in order to not bump against the
ledge.
