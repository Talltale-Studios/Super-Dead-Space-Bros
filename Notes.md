Ledge Hop: If the player's jump is a few pixels too short to make it onto a ledge, a ledge hop can
be performed, which will do a tiny jump, or add the required velocity to a jump that is in progress,
to make it onto the ledge.

Ledge Climb: If the player's jump is a bit too short to make it onto a ledge, a ledge climb can be
performed, which will perform an animation to climb onto the ledge.

Ledge Push: If the player jumps up the side of their head would've bumped against the edge of a
ledge, the player character will be pushed away from the ledge in order to not bump against the
ledge.
